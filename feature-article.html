						<p>Worldwide, low-back pain affects 60-70 percent of people at some point in their lives. The economic

							around $26 billion;
							126 million of these cases are due to work-related ergonomics.ยน The prevalence of these painful
							conditions underscores
							the urgent need for effective prevention and treatment strategies.</p>
						<p>Despite the extreme frequency of low-back pain, there are countless cases in which health-care
							practitioners are unable

							unpredictable at best
							and detrimental at worst.</p>

						</div>
						<p>Let's take a look at the onset of low-back pain, identify the most common conditions that cause it,
							and outline key
							assessment principles used for evaluation. While detailed evaluation protocols for each condition
							are available, they
							are beyond the scope of this article. Let's dive in.</p>
						<h2>Common Causes</h2>
						<p>Low-back pain is a common condition characterized by discomfort or pain in the lumbar region of the
							spine. This area,
							known as the lower back, encompasses the vertebrae, discs, nerves, and muscles extending from the
							lower rib cage to the
							pelvis. Low-back pain can be acute, lasting a few days to weeks, or chronic, persisting for three
							months or longer. The
							pain intensity varies widely, ranging from a constant, dull ache to sharp, movement-limiting
							sensations.</p>
						<p>Multiple factors contribute to low-back pain. Common mechanical causes include muscle hypertonicity
							(likely
							underdiagnosed), muscle strains, and ligament sprains. Dysfunctions of the structural elements of
							the spine, the
							vertebrae, joints, discs, and associated neural structures (spinal cord and nerve roots) also
							contribute to pain in this
							region.</p>
						<p>Injuries from accidents or poor ergonomics and repetitive use frequently lead to low-back pain.
							Additionally, conditions
							like herniated discs, spinal stenosis, and osteoarthritis can trigger discomfort. Lifestyle factors
							such as poor
							posture, sedentary habits, and obesity increase the risk of developing this condition.</p>
						<p>Back injuries typically result from a unique combination of factors. As massage therapists, we must
							understand these
							multifaceted causes to tailor our treatments effectively. When addressing low-back pain, we need to
							consider not only
							the immediate physical factors but also the broader context of our client's lifestyles and
							activities. This
							comprehensive approach allows us to provide more targeted and effective care, addressing both the
							symptoms and the
							underlying causes of low-back pain.</p>
						<h2>Primary Locomotor Tissues</h2>
						<p>Let's explore the role of biomechanical causes of low-back pain in more detail. Massage and other
							soft-tissue treatments
							have an integral role in treating most of these conditions.</p>
						<h3>Myofascial Pain</h3>
						<p>Muscular pain comes from two main factors: muscular dysfunction and muscle strains. Pain in the
							myofascial (muscular and
							fascial) tissues accounts for a large percentage of back pain complaints. The back muscles have
							high demands of
							stability and movement placed on them. Back pain results when muscles are overwhelmed either from
							chronic overloading or
							sudden high-intensity forces.</p>
						<p>There are several ways that myofascial back pain can develop. It usually develops when muscles are
							acutely or
							chronically overloaded, and the body senses the potential for injury if the current demands
							continue. A typical muscular
							reaction to perceived overload is for the muscle to contract in a protective reaction (spasm). The
							reaction often
							exceeds what is needed for protection and creates continual overactivity, called hypertonicity, and
							subsequent pain in
							the muscle.</p>
						<p>In some cases, localized areas of tightness, called myofascial trigger points, develop in the
							muscle and can remain
							tender locally or refer pain or other sensations. The common factor with these different aspects of
							muscular pain is
							excess activity in the neuromuscular system, leading to excess contraction and further pain.</p>
						<p>Muscle strains are frequently cited as a cause of low-back pain, but this diagnosis is often
							overused. Many cases
							diagnosed as muscle strains don't match the symptomatic profile or onset consistent with the forces
							necessary to
							overstretch or tear a muscle (the definition of a strain). Muscle strains would be more likely in
							the core stabilizing
							muscles like the erector spinae or quadratus lumborum (Image 1). Muscle strains may undoubtedly
							occur in the back, but
							it's more likely that general muscular hypertonicity is underdiagnosed while muscle strains are
							overdiagnosed.</p>

							</div>
							<figcaption>Image 1. Erector spinae and quadratus lumborum are susceptible to strains. Image

						</figure>
						<p>Chronic loading, especially in repetitive motion activities, is the main cause of tendon injuries.
							These injuries, such
							as tendinitis/tendinosis or tenosynovitis, are most common in tendons that span joints with a
							significant range of
							motion. Thus, they are common in the extremity's large power muscles that are exposed to high loads
							and repetitive
							motions.</p>
						<p>Unlike limb tendons, however, spinal tendons seldom encounter the conditions that lead to overuse
							tendon injuries. The
							spinal muscles are used more for trunk stabilization and positioning and less to perform power
							movements. Spinal tendons
							are relatively short and small, with minimal range of motion at individual segments. These tendons
							are rarely overloaded
							to the extent that tendon injuries develop. Additionally, these tendons don't have synovial
							sheaths, meaning they are
							not susceptible to conditions like tenosynovitis that impact the tendon sheath.</p>
						<h3>Ligament Sprain</h3>
						<p>Ligament sprains, like muscle strains, are often overdiagnosed in cases of low-back pain. After
							seeing a family
							physician, clients may get a diagnosis of lumbar sprain/strain. This diagnosis is vague, indicating
							either a muscle
							strain, ligament sprain, or both without specifying the affected tissue. This lack of precision
							makes determining the
							most effective treatment approach difficult.</p>
						<p>A true ligament sprain involves overstretching or tearing ligament fibers, which requires
							substantial force. While you
							may feel localized soft-tissue pain near ligaments, actual ligament damage is less common than
							often assumed. The
							spine's major ligaments, such as the anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments, are large and
							positioned close to
							the vertebral bodies, making them resistant to sprains.</p>
						<p>Smaller ligaments connecting transverse processes, spinous processes, and adjacent bones like the
							pelvis are more
							susceptible to sprains (Image 2). These smaller ligaments farther away from the body's center are
							more likely to suffer
							an actual sprain. However, pinpointing a specific sprained ligament in the spine remains
							challenging due to the complex
							anatomy and spinal mechanics.</p>

						<h2>Structural Conditions</h2>
						<p>Now, let's review low-back pain that results from structural alteration. While massage plays a
							primary role in
							addressing muscle, tendon, and ligament issues, it serves more as an adjunct treatment for
							structural and systemic
							conditions.</p>
						<h3>Intervertebral Disc Herniation</h3>
						<p>Intervertebral disc herniation often comes to mind when discussing back pain. This condition occurs
							when compressive
							forces push the inner disc (nucleus pulposus) against the outer cartilage rim (annulus fibrosus).
							Continued pressure
							causes the annulus to protrude against nearby structures, mainly nerve roots (Image 3). This
							pressure typically causes
							radiating pain down the lower extremity along the affected nerve roots' sensory path rather than
							back pain itself. A
							disc herniation diagnosis as a cause of back pain is not as common as it used to be. MRI studies
							have shown that disc
							herniations don't always correlate with pain, leading to a more measured approach in diagnosis and
							treatment.</p>
						<figure class="information__figure figure">
							<div class="figure__image figure__image--feature figure__image--contain">
								<img src="img/feature/4.png"
									alt="Illustration points to the erector spinae and quadratus lumborum.">
								<figcaption>Image 3. Posterior/lateral protrusion of the disc. Image courtesy of Complete
									Anatomy.</figcaption>
							</div>
						</figure>
						<p>Cauda equina syndrome, a serious type of disc protrusion, requires special attention. Unlike
							typical disc herniations
							that protrude posterolaterally, cauda equina syndrome involves straight posterior protrusion,
							pressing on the spinal
							cord fibers in the lower back (the cauda equina). Symptoms include bilateral lower extremity pain,
							sensory and motor
							disturbances in the pelvic floor region, and potential bowel, bladder, sexual dysfunction, or
							sensory impairment. Refer
							clients presenting these symptoms immediately to emergency care to prevent permanent neurological
							damage.</p>
						<h3>Degenerate Disc Disease/Spinal Stenosis</h3>
						<p>Degenerative disc disease results from the intervertebral disc losing water content and flattening
							under compressive
							loads. As the discs flatten, the joints come closer together, decreasing the space where the nerve
							roots exit the spine
							(the intervertebral foramen). This condition is known as spinal stenosis and results in the discs
							pressing on the nerve
							roots and causing nerve pain. Vertebral contact can also lead to arthritic pain in the joints and
							the development of
							spinal tumors or bone spurs, decreasing the space further and leading to more nerve impingement.
							Age-related changes to
							the spinal structure often show up in detailed imaging studies.</p>
						<h3>Facet Joint Pathology</h3>
						<p>Facet (zygapophyseal) joints are the only direct articulation points between adjacent vertebrae.
							These are standard
							synovial joints with an articulating surface and a surrounding joint capsule. Like any joint, they
							are susceptible to
							degenerative changes like arthritis. Certain postures, like an exaggerated lumbar lordosis (Image
							4), can increase
							compression on these joints, potentially contributing to low-back pain.</p>

								<figcaption>Image 4. Facet joints further compressed in exaggerated lumbar lordosis. Image
									courtesy of Complete Anatomy.</figcaption>
							</div>
						</figure>
						<h3>Spondylolysis and Spondylolisthesis</h3>
						<p>Spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis are two closely related conditions. Spondylolysis involves a
							stress fracture in the
							vertebra's pars interarticularis (Image 5), typically resulting from excessive compressive loading
							during spine
							extension. If severe enough, this can progress to spondylolisthesis, where the vertebral body
							separates from the
							posterior vertebral arch and slides (usually anteriorly) on the vertebra below. This condition most
							commonly occurs at
							the L5-S1 junction.</p>

									alt="Illustration points to the erector spinae and quadratus lumborum.">
								<figcaption>Image 5. Pars interarticularis. Image courtesy of Complete Anatomy.</figcaption>
							</div>
						</figure>
						<h3>Systemic Disorders/Inflammatory Conditions</h3>
						<p>Systemic inflammatory conditions are known to lead to back pain; two of the more common conditions
							in this category are
							ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis. Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory
							disease that primarily
							affects the spine and the sacroiliac joints, leading to pain and stiffness. Over time, this
							condition can cause the
							vertebrae to fuse, resulting in a rigid spine and a forward-stooped posture. The hallmark symptom
							is lower-back pain
							that improves with exercise but not with rest, often accompanied by morning stiffness that lasts
							for an extended period.</p>
						<p>Rheumatoid arthritis, on the other hand, is an autoimmune disorder that causes inflammation in the
							joints, including
							those in the spine. This condition leads to pain, swelling, and potential joint deformity. Unlike
							ankylosing
							spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis can symmetrically affect multiple joints throughout the body and
							is often associated
							with systemic symptoms such as fatigue, fever, and weight loss.</p>
						<h3>Referred Pain</h3>
						<p>In some cases, back pain results not from local movement tissue disorders but from other organs or
							systems that refer
							pain to the back. Conditions such as kidney stones and pancreatitis can manifest as significant
							discomfort in the lower
							back, even though their primary pathology is elsewhere. For instance, kidney stones can cause
							sharp, intense pain in the
							lower back as they move through the urinary tract. Similarly, pancreatitis can lead to upper
							abdominal pain that
							radiates to the lower back. Symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and painful urination often accompany
							both conditions.</p>
						<p style="font-size: 1.5rem;font-weight: 300;line-height: 1.2;">When addressing low-back pain,
							consider not only the
							immediate physical factors but also the
							broader context of our
							client's lifestyles and activities. This comprehensive approach allows us to provide more targeted
							and effective care,
							addressing both the symptoms and the underlying causes of low-back pain.</p>
						<h3>Psychogenic Factors</h3>
						<p>Psychological factors such as depression, anxiety, or past trauma, rather than direct physical
							tissue damage, can
							influence the pain experience and is called <em>psychogenic pain</em>. This type of pain can
							manifest in various forms, including
							headaches, muscle aches, back pain, and abdominal pain, often without any apparent physical injury
							or pathology. Despite
							the lack of physical evidence, psychogenic pain is genuine and can significantly impact a person's
							quality of life.</p>
						<p>The exact mechanisms behind psychogenic pain are complex and involve the interplay between the
							brain, emotions, and past
							experiences. For example, stress or anxiety can amplify pain signals, making pain feel more intense
							or widespread.
							Similarly, past trauma or ongoing emotional distress can trigger or exacerbate pain symptoms.
							Treatment for psychogenic
							pain typically involves a multidisciplinary approach that includes psychotherapy, such as
							cognitive-behavioral therapy,
							physical therapy, and sometimes medications to address underlying mental health conditions. Massage
							is a valuable
							adjunct treatment in many cases of psychogenic pain.</p>
						<h3>Nonspecific Back Pain</h3>
						<p>Nonspecific low-back pain presents a unique challenge in diagnosis and treatment. This category
							encompasses many
							potential complaints and can involve issues of multiple types, not just locomotor tissues.
							Practitioners often use this
							label when they can't determine a specific cause, making it a catchall term for unexplained back
							pain.</p>
						<p>As a diagnostic term, nonspecific back pain sparks debate among experts. Renowned back researcher
							Stuart McGill argues
							that the diagnosis results from inadequate assessment, suggesting a more thorough evaluation would
							reveal a specific
							cause.ยฒ However, others maintain that nonspecific back pain is a legitimate classification,
							particularly for cases of
							nociplastic pain (that which does not seem to have a clear cause).</p>
						<p>As massage therapists, we must approach nonspecific low-back pain with both skepticism and
							open-mindedness. While a
							thorough assessment may reveal a specific cause in many cases, we should also recognize that some
							pain defies precise
							classification. In these instances, focusing on symptom management and overall function improvement
							may be more
							beneficial than searching for a specific cause. Remember, what one practitioner deems nonspecific
							might be identifiable
							to another with different or more advanced assessment skills or perspectives.</p>
						<h2>Key Assessment Protocols</h2>
						<p>Determining the issues contributing to low-back pain is challenging, yet understanding your
							client's condition is
							crucial for effective treatment. Assessment helps rule out serious conditions and potential red
							flags. While a complete
							evaluation is beyond this article's scope, we'll cover highlights to consider during your
							evaluation process.</p>
						<p>A comprehensive assessment includes history, observation, palpation, range-of-motion and resistance
							testing, and special
							tests (abbreviated as HOPRS). Let's explore the essential factors in each section, focusing on
							aspects most relevant to
							massage therapists.</p>
						<h3>History</h3>
						<p>The history is the most critical part of any evaluation process. Detailed questioning about
							symptoms, onset, aggravating
							factors, and previous treatments provides invaluable information. To conduct an effective history,
							you need in-depth
							knowledge of various conditions.</p>
						<p>Here are key points to listen for:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>How the pain began is crucialโ</strong>This information helps determine if the pain was
								sudden or developed chronically. For
								acute onset injuries, the client should describe the initiating movement or activity in detail.
								Your kinesiology
								knowledge will help you assess the likelihood of specific tissue injuries. Note the amount of
								potential force in any
								acute injury. Muscle injuries are more common and occur with less force, while ligament sprains
								require significant
								force. More than one tissue type may be involved in an acute injury.</li>
							<li><strong>Chronic pain points to different suspectsโ</strong>Identify if static postures
								exaggerate the pain, as this can indicate specific
								tissue involvement. For example, disc herniation pain often worsens with prolonged sitting due
								to disc compression and
								subsequent pressure on nerve roots. Facet joint irritation may increase with extended periods of
								standing in an
								exaggerated lumbar lordosis. Conditions like spondylolysis, stenosis, and degenerative disc
								disease often worsen with
								prolonged static loading. Conversely, ligament pain rarely results from chronic loading.</li>
							<li><strong>The nature of the pain sensation also provides crucial cluesโ</strong>Sharp, shooting,
								or stabbing pain, especially if it
								radiates down the lower extremity, suggests nerve root compression. Radiating pain is common in
								conditions like disc
								herniation, stenosis, degenerative disc disease, or spondylolisthesis. Shooting pain to the
								lower extremity is not
								typical of muscular or ligamentous injury, indicating neural irritation is more likely.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Taking a comprehensive history is an art that improves with practice. Learning more about various
							conditions and how to
							evaluate their etiology through your intake history will enhance your skills.</p>
						<h3>Observation</h3>
						<p>Observation can help identify visual clues that shed light on the client's complaint, though some
							conditions lack
							visible signs. Here are some key physical signs to look for:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Muscular hypertonicity can produce visual cues like a lateral pelvic tilt from a tight
								quadratus lumborum.</li>
							<li>Muscle strains might show swelling, redness, or bruising if the affected muscle is superficial.
							</li>
							<li>Ligament injuries are usually too deep for visible signs, but if severe, they can show similar
								effects as those with
								strains.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Watch your client's movements during the evaluation process. Movement apprehension often indicates
							pain avoidance. The
							pattern of these movements can provide essential clues about involved structures. For instance,
							clients with
							spondylolisthesis or facet joint irritation typically avoid extension movements because these
							aggravate symptoms.</p>
						<h3>Palpation</h3>
						<p>Palpation is the stronghold of massage therapists, who spend more time palpating soft tissues than
							almost anyone else in
							the health-care system. When you combine this skill with anatomical knowledge, you can not only
							target specific tissues
							but also gain insights throughout the treatment session.</p>
						<p>Muscle dysfunctions like strains or hypertonicity are commonly identified through palpation. Your
							anatomy knowledge is
							essential for determining specific muscles or ligaments involved in strains or sprains. Tenderness
							and pain reproduction
							are primary indicators during palpation. Palpation with moderate pressure may also reveal reactive
							muscle splinting
							(reactive contractions). Even very gentle palpation can help detect a lack of mobility in
							superficial fascial tissues,
							which indicates deeper muscle issues. Some deep structural spinal problems, such as disc
							herniations and stenosis,
							cannot be palpated due to their depth. With severe spondylolisthesis, you might feel a bit of the
							vertebral
							displacement.</p>
						<h3>Range-of-Motion and Resistance Testing</h3>
						<p>Range-of-motion (ROM) and resistance testing involve three evaluation movements at each joint:
							active range of motion
							(AROM), passive range of motion (PROM), and manual resistive tests (MRT). Specific tissue
							pathologies often produce
							characteristic and predictable patterns in these tests. For example, a quadratus lumborum strain
							typically causes pain
							during active contraction (concentrically or eccentrically), passive stretching, and a resisted
							contraction (lateral
							lumbar flexion on the affected side).</p>
						<p>The spine presents unique challenges for motion and resistance tests compared to the extremities.
							For instance, testing
							passive elbow flexion is easy by just moving the client's forearm while they relax. Conversely,
							passive torso flexion
							requires getting the client to fully relax while you move their torso, which is quite tricky.
							Alternative positions can
							help you achieve these passive movements.</p>
						<h3>Special Tests</h3>
						<p>Special tests are specialized evaluation procedures designed to indicate the likely presence or
							absence of specific
							conditions. While numerous spinal special tests exist, recent research has questioned the accuracy
							of many of these. The
							tests are less commonly used for muscular hypertonicity, strains, or ligament sprains and more
							often for structural
							conditions like neural involvement from disc herniation or stenosis. Tests like the straight leg
							raise or slump test may
							provide helpful information about potential nerve involvement in back pain.</p>
						<p>Special tests should only be used in conjunction with a comprehensive assessment and not as a
							shortcut in the evaluation
							process. In light of recent research on their validity, I now place greater emphasis on information
							from other aspects
							of the HOPRS assessment process. Developing your assessment skills will significantly enhance your
							treatment success and
							clinical decision-making.</p>
						<h2>Conclusion</h2>
						<p>Understanding how and why low-back pain occurs and its various causes is at the heart of finding an
							effective treatment
							plan. This knowledge allows us to choose the best treatment approaches and techniques that match
							the physiological and
							pain presentation of the client's condition.</p>
						<p>Treatments for low-back pain are as diverse as the myriad types of pain they address. Treating
							these conditions runs the
							gamut from soft-tissue manipulation to corrective surgery. However, soft-tissue therapies continue
							to be effective
							treatments for acute and chronic low-back pain. They can even be helpful when the cause is unknown.
						</p>
						<p>Massage therapy, in particular, offers a unique approach to acute and chronic low-back pain. The
							massage therapist's
							ability to specifically palpate tissue and target key problem areas with hands-on treatment is
							incredibly therapeutic.
							The extensive time spent with clients also allows massage therapists to apply more comprehensive
							treatment.
							Additionally, the relaxing environment maximizes the effects of descending modulation in the
							healing process.</p>
