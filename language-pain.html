							<p>“I'm sorry,” she said. “I feel like I'm terrible at this.”</p>
							<p>My client Ms. Kay was responding to my question about what she was experiencing as I treated her
								back. I was treating
								her lower left lumbar area, which I thought might be responsible for her left hip and lateral
								thigh
								discomfort.</p>

							<p>“I think you are doing just fine, but I'd love to hear more about what you mean,” I said.</p>
							<p>“I can feel how deliberate you are with your touch,” she said. “That amount of specificity
								deserves
								accurate feedback,
								but I'm struggling to do that. I was an English teacher, so I know the power of words to convey
								experience. I'm
								surprised at my inarticulateness and inability to give you helpful guidance. No therapist in the
								past has asked for such
								specific feedback, and I have the sense that it really matters to your approach. This is
								refreshing
								but also far more
								challenging than I expected.”</p>
							<p>
								“Thank you for being so thoughtful about your feedback,” I said. “It does indeed matter and has
								a
								major influence on the
								direction and creation of what we do and how we do it. Clients often assume I can guide my
								treatment just through what I
								feel in my hands. No matter how skilled, I can never fully know what the client experiences
								without
								them telling me.
								There are many kinds of feedback, but accurate, verbal feedback is crucial to success.”
							</p>
							<p>“I wonder why I find that so difficult?” Ms. Kay questioned.</p>
							<p>“One strong possibility is our inadequate vocabulary to describe the experience of pain,” I
								said.
								“We have a few words
								like <em>sharp</em>, <em>dull</em>, <em>aching</em>, and <em>burning</em>, but they in no way
								encapsulate the full range of experiences comprised in pain.”</p>
							<p>After that statement, I explained to Ms. Kay that I had a few extra minutes and would like to
								explore this idea further.
								We went back over each sensitive area previously treated, and she explained what she felt in the
								most descriptive way
								possible. It was a fun experiment, especially with someone whose command of language made the
								difficult process somewhat
								easier. I kept thinking that we need to come up with a better vocabulary to help clients like
								Ms.
								Kay articulate their
								experience.</p>
							<p>After Ms. Kay left, I saw another new client, and the experience was vastly different from the
								moment I asked her why
								she came to see me and how I could help.</p>
							<p>“It just hurts,” she said.</p>
							<p>“What just hurts?” I asked.</p>
							<p>“Well, maybe not painful, but tight and kind of congested,” she replied.</p>
							<p>“But what area are we talking about?” I responded.</p>
							<p>“I think it's my neck.”</p>
							<p>As vague as this sounds, further questions only made the situation less clear. I found myself
								getting impatient and
								frustrated, as if she were evading or dismissing my ever-pointed additional questions. At the
								height of my frustration,
								I realized she was sincere but incapable at giving me direction. I realized I was too focused on
								how I was supposed to
								respond and not focused enough on her struggle.</p>
							<p>At that moment, I was lost in thought at the contrast of these clients. Here were two people,
								both
								in discomfort and
								both struggling with describing and conveying their experiences to me. It's easy to see how both
								could be dismissed and
								invalidated by other health-care providers because their descriptions were so vague. The
								important
								point is that the
								source of their inadequate descriptions was different. The first person, Ms. Kay, struggled with
								clarity of language to
								describe her experience. The second client struggled with clarity of the experience itself
								because
								she was disconnected
								from her body, a condition in the psychological realm called <em>alexithymia</em>. In the
								context
								of bodywork, I might call it<em>somatic illiteracy</em></p>
							<p style="font-size: 1.5rem;font-weight: 300;line-height: 1.2;">Allowing her to find the right
								words
								took time, but she relished the process of codifying and articulating what she
								felt.</p>
							<p>With Ms. Kay, I spent the session giving her the space to find language to describe her
								experience.
								Allowing her to find
								the right words took time, but she relished the process of codifying and articulating what she
								felt.</p>
							<p>The session with the second client was very different—one not about creating language to
								describe
								experience but taking
								the time to fully discover life in the body. The session was a process of updating the somatic
								map
								in her brain and
								rewriting the software to a much higher resolution. I made sure to have her discriminate one
								area
								from the other, such
								as feeling scapular mobility as separate from the thoracic spine or feeling cervical motion as
								independent of shoulder
								motion. I was training her in somatosensory integration, a process of inner discovery and
								wonder.
								It was a bit fatiguing
								for her, like learning a new language, thrilling but exhausting. It was an honor and a privilege
								to
								be a guide and
								witness her process of self-discovery.</p>
							<p>These two clients represent situations often encountered in clinical practice. Two people with
								similar presentations may
								have vastly different reasons for experiencing them. Knowledge is identifying the problem.
								Wisdom
								is identifying the
								underlying context that created it and responding appropriately.</p>
